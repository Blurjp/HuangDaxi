<h4>About These Terms</h4> 
<p>By using the TripShare site, you're agreeing to these terms</p> 
<p>As a user ("You," "Your") of the TripShare site (“Site”), services ("Services"), and visual or verbal information ("Content") provided by TripShare ("Us," "Our," "We"), its users ("User Content" or "User Generated Content"), or partners from whom we may license data or content ("Partner Content" or "Third Party Content"), including, but not limited to, the TripShare website at http://www.TripShare.com, the food@TripShare.com email address, the TripShare application programming interfaces (“TripShare APIs”), and the mobile applications created by TripShare, you are agreeing to be bound by the following Terms and Conditions ("Terms of Service" or "Terms"). You acknowledge that these Terms are part of our Site Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”), which is incorporated by reference, and by accessing or using our Site, you agree to be bound by all of its terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these terms and the terms in our Privacy Policy, please do not access or use this Site or our Services.</p> 
<p>Please read the information below to learn the following regarding your use of this Site:</p> 
<p> 
<em>You are responsible for any consequences of violating these terms</em> 
</p> 
<p>You agree that you are solely responsible for any breach of your obligations under the Terms and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which TripShare may suffer) of any such breach. If you have created an Account or contributed Content ("Your Content") to TripShare, you recognize that violation of these Terms may result in termination of your account and loss of access to Your Content contributed to TripShare.</p> 
<p>The failure of TripShare to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p> 
<p> 
<em>We may modify these terms without explicit notice</em> 
</p> 
<p>These Terms of Service apply to all current features and to new features that are added to the existing Service.</p> 
<p>TripShare reserves the right to modify these Terms of Service without explicit notice. We will notify members with active accounts of material changes to these Terms of Service by email or by posting a notice on our Site. Continued use of the Service after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. You can review our current Terms of Service at any time at <a href="/terms">http://www.TripShare.com/terms</a></p> 
<p>These Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy, which can be found at <a href="/privacy">http://www.TripShare.com/privacy</a>, constitutes the entire agreement between you and TripShare and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and TripShare (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service).</p> 
<h4>Consuming Content</h4> 
<p> 
<em>Content may not be accurate, use at your own risk</em> 
</p> 
<p>Because TripShare relies on User Generated Content, Third Party Content and links to Third Party Content, TripShare makes no claim of accuracy of any User Generated Content or Third Party Content. Any use or reliance on any Content or materials posted via the Services or obtained by you through the Services is at your own risk.

<p>The Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible or liable for the availability, accuracy, content or policies of such websites or resources. Links to such websites or resources do not imply any endorsement by or affiliation with TripShare. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any such websites or resources.</p> 
<p> 
<em>You may encounter inappropriate content</em> 
</p> 
<p>By accessing the Service or following links to third-party websites you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent, inaccurate, objectionable, or otherwise inappropriate. While TripShare does not endorse and reserves the right to remove such Content, you acknowledge and agree that TripShare cannot be responsible for such Content and that you nonetheless may be exposed to such materials.</p> 
<p> 
<em>Content may be protected by copyright laws</em> 
</p> 
<p>Content presented to you as part of the Service may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the person providing that content to TripShare (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this content (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by TripShare or by the owners of that content, in a separate written agreement.</p> 
<p> 
<em>Content may be stored or transmitted by third party vendors</em> 
</p> 
<p>TripShare uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Service.</p> 
<p>The technical processing and transmission of the Service, including Your Content, may be transferred unencrypted and involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.</p> 
<p> 
<em>Mapping services are powered by Google</em> 
</p>

<p> 
<em>You are responsible for your mobile carrier's fees</em>

<p>By submitting or posting Content to TripShare, while you retain intellectual property rights to Your Content, you understand that you may not be able to remove or edit your content within TripShare. While we will make a reasonable effort to enable you to edit or remove content, the public, indexed nature of TripShare makes it impossible to guarantee that content can be removed or changed entirely.</p> 
<p>

<p>All content posted on the Service must comply with U.S. copyright law. You represent and warrant that (i) you own or otherwise possess all rights to use your User Submissions; (ii) you have the permission to use the name and likeness of each identifiable individual person and to use such individual's identifying or personal information; (iii) you are authorized to grant all of the rights described in the TripShare Terms of Service; and (iv) the use of your User Submissions as contemplated by this Agreement will not infringe or violate any intellectual property, privacy, publicity, contract or other rights of any person or entity.</p>

TripShare will not be responsible or liable for any use of your Content by TripShare in accordance with these Terms. You represent and warrant that you have all the rights, power and authority necessary to grant the rights granted herein to any Content that you submit.</p> 
<p> 
<em>Your content always belongs to you</em>

<p> 
<em>Your content may be modified for technical reasons</em> 
</p>
